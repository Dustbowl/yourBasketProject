# 4330-Project
An app to add efficiency to the user's cooking life by allowing the user to scan items directly to their inventory where the app will generate recipes based on the contents of their pantry/refrigerator.  The app will also allow for favoriting and the ability to quickly add the ingredients required to cook favorited recipes for reference later.
